# ðŸŽ„ Twinkling Tunes - IoT Christmas Tree Challenge ðŸŽ„

## About This Project ðŸŽ¶

This repository contains my entry for the **Twinkling Tunes IoT Christmas Tree Challenge**ðŸŽ„. Using Arduino and LEDs, Iâ€™ve created a sequence of light patterns synchronized to the classic holiday song **Deck the Halls**. The project is designed and simulated in **Tinkercad** and showcases a festive combination of creativity, coding, and holiday spirit. ðŸŽ…ðŸŽ‰

âœ¨ **Features**

- **Hardware Components**: Standard LEDs (simulated in Tinkercad, no physical hardware used).
- **Software Environment**: Arduino IDE with C++ code.
- **Music Synchronization**: Lights blink in rhythm with "Deck the Halls."
- **Easy Simulation**: Ready to simulate in Tinkercad or run on your own Arduino setup.

ðŸ’» **Code Overview**

This project uses **12 pins** on the Arduino to control individual LEDs. Each LED corresponds to different patterns that sync with the **Deck the Halls** song. Timing and patterns are controlled by using `delay()` functions to match the rhythm and melody.

ðŸŽµ **Suggested Rhythm for "Deck the Halls**

Here's how the light sequence corresponds to the **"Deck the Halls"** melody:

- **"Deck the halls with boughs of holly"**: LEDs 2, 4, 6, and 8 blink in sync (Red lights).
- **"Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la"**: LEDs 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13 blink together (Green lights).
- **"Tis the season to be jolly"**: LEDs 2, 5, 8, and 11 blink in a pattern (Combination of Red, Green, and Yellow).
- **"Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la"**: LEDs 3, 6, 9, 12 blink in sync (Blue lights).
- **"Don we now our gay apparel"**: LEDs 4, 7, 10, and 13 blink together (Mix of colors).
- **"Troll the ancient Yuletide carol"**: LEDs 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 blink together (All LEDs blinking for a grand finale).

ðŸ”§ **Code Adjustments for "Deck the Halls" Rhythm**

The synchronized code controls light patterns based on the music. **Red, Green, Yellow, and Blue** colors alternate to create a vibrant and festive effect. Each LED corresponds to a particular note or phrase in the song.
